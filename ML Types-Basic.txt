ML :
ML is branch of AI, a technique that learn from data by itself & without being explicitly programmed.

Types of ML:

1.Supervised ML
   Machine learns from labelled data & under supervision of programmer
2.Unsupervised ML
   Learns from Un labelled data
3.Reinforcement learning
   How intelligent Agents take actions in an environment to maximize its rewards


1.SUPERVISED LEARNING :
   Learns from labelled data.

    Types of Supervised Learning:

     1.Classification:
        Predicting a class or discrete values
        Eg. True or False ,Yes or No ,Cat or Dog etc..
       Algorithms:
        Decision Tree classification
        Random Forest classification
        Logistic regression
        k nearest neighbour

     2.Regression:
        Predicting continuous values as input value varies..
        Eg. price ,salary , age etc..
       Algorithms:
        Polynomial regression
        Support vector Machine(SVM)

2.UNSUPERVISED LEARNING :
   Learns from un labelled data.

   Types of Unsupervised Learning:

    1.Clustering:
        Grouping the similar data points
        Eg. Consider a basket containing mix of apples & mangoes ,clustering divides into two groups based on features like color ,shape etc..
       Algorithms:
        K-means clustering
        Hierarchical clustering
        Dense-based clustering 

    2.Association:
        To find important relationship between data points
        Eg. Suggesting movies in Netflix etc..
       Algorithms:
        Principal component analysis
        Apriori
        Eclat

3.REINFORCEMENT LEARNING :
    -Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment. 
    -The agent learns to achieve a specific goal by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions. 
    -This feedback guides the agent to optimize its behavior over time.
  Example : 
     Game AI- Chess, Go, and StarCraft (e.g., AlphaGo, AlphaZero)
     Robotics- walking, grasping objects, or navigation
     Autonomous Vehicles
