Deep learning:
 Subfield of ML that uses Artificial Neural Networks to learn from the data,( Excels at handling large data).
Each neuron has a mathematical function.

 Example :
* Diabetic Retinopathy
 It determines if a person has retina deficiency or not , the output will be in binary either yes or no & also give excess data about retina like medical reports

Process:
 Images of healthy retina & unhealthy retina to the neural network after processing predicts output as either YES or NO

 Applications of DL:
1. Healthcare like above example
2. Autonomous cars
3. Computer vision



Data science Libraries are used to enhance the data science workflow & they provide pre-built functions and algorithms , saving time & effort for Data scientists.

Libraries:

1. Numpy :
 The foundational for numerical computations and array manipulation
2. Pandas :
 Essential for Data analysis and manipulation like creating DataFrames & processing it
3. Matplotlib :
 For creating static ,animated , and interactive visualizations
4. Scikit-learn : 
 Implements various machine learning algorithms for classification , regression ,clustering etc..
